# Electricity-Billing-System-Java-Project
Electricity Billing System is a software-based application.  
1. 
This project aims at serving the department of electricity by 
computerizing the billing system.   
2. 
It mainly focuses on the calculation of units consumed during 
the specified time and the money to be charged by the 
electricity offices.  
3.  This computerized system will make the overall billing system 
easy, accessible, comfortable, and effective for consumers.  
To design the billing system more service oriented and simple, the 
following features have been implemented in the project. The 
application has high speed of performance with accuracy and 
efficiency.  
The software provides facility of data sharing, it does not require 
any staff as in the conventional system. Once it is installed on the 
system only the meter readings are to be given by the admin where 
customer can view all details, it has the provision of security 
restriction.  
The electricity billing software calculates the units consumed by 
the customer and makes bills, it requires small storage for installation 
and functioning. There is provision for debugging if any problem is 
encountered in the system.  
The system excludes the need of maintaining paper electricity bill, 
administrator does not have to keep a manual track of the users, users 
can pay the amount without visiting the office. Thus, it saves human 
efforts and resources. 

# Purpose
The main aim of our project is to satisfy customer by saving their time by 
payment process, maintaining records, and allowing the customer to view 
his/her records and permitting them to update their details                     
The firm handles all the work manually, which is very tedious 
and mismatched. 

# Scope
• To keep the information of consuming unit energy of current 
month.  
• To keep the information of Customer.  
• To keep the information of consuming unit energy of previous 
month.  
• To calculate the units consumed every month regularly.  
• To generate the bills adding penalty and rent. To save the 
time by implementing payment process online. 
# Applicability
The manual system is suffering from a series of drawbacks. Since whole 
of the bills is to be maintained with hands the process of keeping and maintaining 
the information is very tedious and lengthy to customer. It is very time 
consuming and laborious process because, staff need to be visited the customers 
place every month to give the bills and to receive the payments. For this reason, 
we have provided features Present system is partially automated (computerized), 
existing system is quite laborious as one must enter same information at different 
places. 
# Conclusion
After all the hard work is done for electricity bill management system is 
here. It is a software which helps the user to work with the billing cycles, 
paying bills, managing different DETAILS under which are working etc. 
This software reduces the amount of manual data entry and gives 
greater efficiency. The User Interface of it is very friendly and can be easily 
used by anyone. It also decreases the amount of time taken to write details and 
other modules.
